# Dashboard Hero

The rationale and design decisions behind modern frameworks are ultimately unfit for the vast majority of projects.

Building an UI interface has become insanely complicated. As a software architect with extensive experience, i struggled with modern frameworks. Time to step back, and take a deep breath. React, Angular and Vue.js were built with large projects in mind - but not all projects make it or even need that scale. As a matter of fact, 99% of projects are unfit for the complexity of those frameworks.

Too many get stuck on building decent UI - we aim to help developers of all backgrounds(and solopreneurs, small organizations) ship their project.
